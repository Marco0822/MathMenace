Lemonomics, an interactive educational economics game for children. A project created by Marco, Misha, Mark and Noah.

Lemonomics is a game where the player runs a lemonade stand in different economic scenarios to learn about different economic principles.

Assets were designed by Noah Cho and taken from a spline demo project. This project loads a 3d scene designed in spline and implements custom game logic in javascript to run player interactions.
